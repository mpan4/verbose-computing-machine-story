One day a man found an old book in his attic.
The book contained pictures and symbols of an unknown world.
Confused, the man went and asked his friend Elon Musk for help.
Little did he know, Elon had long since blasted off to mars on a billion dollar tesla yacht.
Forlorn, the man put the book away, and for twenty years never picked it up again. 
Several millenia later, his granddaughter picked it up. She read the fables of the unknown world, and 
noticed a footnote mentioning a man named Elon. This lead to her searching for many things on the 
internet, and lead her to research Dogecoin, the pre-eminant currency of the time, as well as Tesla, which 
she found out, was not just the pre-eminant space ship manufacturer! What a wonderous place the internet can be.
