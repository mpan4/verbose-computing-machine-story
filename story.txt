One day a man found an old book in his attic.
The book contained pictures and symbols of an unknown world.
Confused, the man went and asked his friend Elon Musk for help.
Little did he know, Elon had long since blasted off to mars on a billion dollar tesla yacht.
Forlorn, the man put the book away, and for twenty years never picked it up again.
